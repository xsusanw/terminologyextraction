CONTENT: With nearly all the ballots now counted in the 2024 election, we can fully evaluate the performance of the national and battleground polls this cycle. The verdict: They weren’t perfect, but they were more right than wrong — especially given the polling industry’s challenges and recent misses. Let’s start with the presidential horse race numbers. The final national NBC News poll had Donald Trump and Kamala Harris tied at 49% each, while the national RealClearPolitics average of the two-way contest was Harris 48.7%, Trump 48.6%. And The New York Times’ average was Harris 49%, Trump 48%. The actual result in the popular vote as it currently stands, which you can expect to change slightly amid the very last counting of ballots: Trump 49.9%, Harris 48.3%.The 2024 national polls — on average — slightly overstated support for Harris and understated it for Trump. But they did turn in one of the best performances in presidential polling over the past decade, according to historical data from the Pew Research Center. It was certainly better than polling’s big miss in 2020.
The battleground state polls also weren’t far off the mark, either, although their misses were slightly larger than what we saw in the national polling.
If there’s a perception the polls were wrong in 2024, it’s due less to the actual level of polling error and more to the mistaken impression that political horse race polls can be precise measurements — for example, that 49%-48% or 50%-48% results can perfectly predict who’s going to win a contest and by how much.
Given polls’ margins of error, historically low response rates when reaching voters, different assumptions about the electorate and, yes, past polling misses, expecting that kind of precision from political polls has become a fool’s errand.
In other words, all that those 49%-48% and 50%-48% results can tell us is that the race is close.
And that’s exactly what the presidential election proved to be nationally and in the key battlegrounds.
What else the polls got right
Beyond signaling that the 2024 presidential election was competitive and uncertain, the polls nailed the political atmospherics that shaped the contest.
That included an electorate that mostly saw the nation headed in the wrong direction, with an incumbent president, Joe Biden, whose approval rating was stuck in the low 40s — a historical danger zone for the party controlling the White House.
As it turns out, the NBC News Exit Poll found 73% of voters saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the country’s direction, and only 40% approved of Biden’s job performance.
Additionally, the polls foretold many of the key demographic trends that ended up defining the 2024 election, including Trump’s gains with Latino voters.
The NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC Latino poll was among the surveys showing those Trump gains well before the election. Many polls also caught on early to Biden and Democrats’ relative struggles with young voters compared to other recent elections, particularly among young men.
Another thing the polls got mostly right in the 2024 election were Democratic downballot candidates who had been consistently overperforming Biden (when he was in the race) and then Harris (once she became the nominee), as well as Republican downballot candidates who had been underperforming Trump in the polls.
That dynamic played out in the election, with Democratic Senate candidates winning in four states — Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin — despite Harris losing in those same states.
What the polls got wrong
But the polls, including the NBC News survey, erred in overstating the size of the gender gap when it came to Harris’ support among female voters and Trump’s backing among men.
According to the exit poll, Harris won female voters by 8 points, and Trump won men by 13 points — a 21-point gender gap that was consistent with recent presidential elections. That was smaller than the 30-point-plus gender gap that the NBC News poll had been showing.
(That said, there was a massive gender gap when combined with race and education, with Harris winning white women with college degrees by 16 points, and with Trump winning white men without college degrees by 40 points — a whopping 56-point gap in the margin between those two different groups.)
And most significantly, the polls once again understated Trump’s support, albeit by a smaller amount than they did in 2020. That came despite polling outfits recalibrating and using new weighting methods in their polls in an attempt not to miss Trump’s voters.
Still, this was the first presidential cycle where many polls showed Trump either ahead or essentially tied — which wasn’t the case in 2016 or 2020, even though that’s how those elections turned out in many contests.
The mixed record on party ID
One of the biggest divides in the 2024 polling were the national polls (including NBC, CNBC and The Wall Street Journal) showing Republicans with an advantage in party identification, versus other national polls that had Democrats with the lead in party ID.
It was the latter group of polls that usually showed Harris ahead of Trump, although within the margin of error.
But in the end, Republicans indeed enjoyed the advantage in party ID, according to the exit poll.
That was a major story in the 2024 election: There were more self-identified Republican voters than Democratic voters

He denies any wrongdoing.Trump's pick for health secretary is Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.Trump nominated his long time ally Pam Bondi to be attorney general. His first choice, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew after facing intense scrutiny over allegations - which he denies - of wrongdoing, related to drugs, bribes and sex.Trump's picks for cabinet roles must be approved by the US Senate.Billionaire businessman Elon Musk will head up the newly-announced Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alongside former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, with a brief to cut spending and eliminate waste.Doge will be an advisory body rather than an official government department, and Musk and Ramaswamy have said they will "serve as outside volunteers".Trump has nominated two relatives: his daughter Tiffany's father-in-law, Massad Boulos, as an adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs; and his other daughter Ivanka’s father-in-law Charles Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.He has nominated businessman Warren Stephens to be ambassador to the UK.Once every valid vote has been counted, a process known as the electoral college formally confirms the election result. This is due to happen on 17 December.In each state, a varying number of electoral college votes are up for grabs. It is securing the majority of these – and not the backing of voters themselves – that ultimately wins the presidency.Generally, states award all of their electoral college votes to whoever wins the popular vote.The new US Congress then meets on 6 January to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president. As outgoing vice-president, Kamala Harris will preside over this process.It was this meeting of Congress that Trump supporters tried to stop in 2021, when they marched on the US Capitol after Trump refused to concede to Biden.Trump will be sworn in as president during the inauguration ceremony at the Capitol on 20 January.

However, the White House has confirmed that Biden will attend Trump's swearing-in.The 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits anyone from holding presidential office three times.This applies even if - as is the case with Trump - the two terms were not consecutive.Theoretically the amendment wouldn't stop a former president from becoming vice-president in a future administration, but constitutional experts say this is extremely unlikely to happen.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Black and Latino voters moved toward Republican Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election, and some of the biggest shifts were particularly among men under age 45. (November 10) (AP Video: Sharon Johnson)WASHINGTON (AP) — Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020.Leija’s rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump’s economic policies, especially tax cuts.“I am a blue-collar worker,” Leija said. “So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what I do.”For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats’ rhetoric not matching their actions. “It’s been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept their promises to what they’re going to do for the minority communities,” he said.Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought the former president’s “minority community outreach really showed up.”Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters.Even as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino voters, it wasn’t enough to give the vice president the White House, because of the gains Trump made.Voters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as well.About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.Juan Proaño, CEO of LULAC, the nation’s largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump’s messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos.“I think it’s important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump,” Proaño said. "(Latino) men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.”The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump’s hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color.“I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic,” Harkins said. “And I think unfortunately, even if it’s a very small percentage, you know, when you’re talking about an election like we just had it can be very impactful.”While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue.A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as “not so good” or “poor,” compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape.That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress.This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said.“Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,” Uscanga said. “Gas, grocery shopping even as a college student, everything has gone up in price and that is a big concern for me and other issues like immigration.”Having grown up selling tamales and used cars, and washing cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said.“Under the Trump presidency more opportunities were abound,” Uscanga said. “I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016 but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019, I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying and that’s why I started supporting him after that.”Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters.“Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters,” said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign.“For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate,” Woodbury said.A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%.Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader.David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him.“I’m satisfied with the result. I don’t feel slighted. I wasn’t let down. I wasn’t pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position,” he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, “I’d rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.”Figueroa reported from Austin, Texas.

CONTENT: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.On top of maintaining the House, Republicans will take control of the Senate and the White House in January, handing them complete control of Washington for the first time since early 2019.While the incoming Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill have big ideas about how to spend their political capital, they will be limited by slim majorities in the House and Senate.For a better idea of what to expect, I talked to CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox, who spends most of her time living and breathing in the rarified air of the Capitol building and the subterranean tunnels where representatives and senators walk or ride special trains back and forth from their offices.Our conversation, edited for style and length, is below:WOLF: The current Congress doesn’t leave until January. They have a lot of work to do to fund the government. What’s going to happen in the next month or so?FOX: The most likely scenario right now is that they come up with a short-term patch, which they’re working toward right now, that would fund the government into probably early spring.RELATED ARTICLE
What happens between now and Inauguration DayThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, has made clear his preference would be March. So that would give them an opportunity to punt, basically. It also gives Johnson an opportunity to get through his speaker race without having to pass what is known as the omnibus, or end-of-year, multi-bill extravaganza that we’ve seen in years past at the holidays.That’s something that’s really revolting to his right flank. Kicking this can into March and then dealing with it then probably is beneficial for Johnson.I would note that sticking a funding fight smack dab in the middle of the first 100 days (of Donald Trump’s presidency) would be complicated. It could make it hard to get the legislation that they want to focus on through. It just is another thing to check off the list, in addition to confirming an entire Cabinet.WOLF: Trump’s election and Republicans gaining unified government – has that inoculated Johnson from challenges to his speakership?FOX: These things can change and turn on a dime, but Johnson’s obviously got Trump’s backing. The two of them are very close, and Johnson has gone out of his way to maintain that relationship, because he knows it can be so pivotal when you’re dealing with the kind of narrow majority that Johnson has.It’s not just that Trump’s helpful to preserving his speakership. Trump is helpful to getting people on board to any piece of the agenda that they want to move forward. If you think about down the road when they do tax reform, and you have just a handful of votes to lose, you’ve got to convince people who aren’t used to saying yes to say yes.My sense is if they can kick the can down the road on the spending bill, Johnson has a much easier time than we saw Kevin McCarthy have two years ago with getting the speakership.WOLF: Passing major legislation is difficult when you have a large majority. This will be the most evenly divided Congress since the Great Depression. How will that affect Republicans’ ability to pass anything major?FOX: We saw a really big indicator of how aware Republicans are of that reality earlier this week, when you had (incoming Senate Majority Leader) John Thune making clear to Republican senators that the most likely scenario is that they punt tax reform to later in the year, and they do a smaller piece of legislation that deals with defense, energy and immigration in the first 100 days.To me, and I think to Republican senators who I’ve spoken to, that signaled that they know they need some practice making sure they can move through this complicated budget process known as reconciliation. They need to make sure they can do it before they try to do it on tax, because tax is just a beast.They did it in 2017. They’ve obviously shown they can pass tax reform, but it is not easy to do, and there’s going to be a lot of disagreements between Senate Republicans and House Republicans. You’re dealing with a very narrow majority in the House and you’re dealing with a not-so-big majority in the Senate.When I saw that announcement from Thune, that he had told Republicans in their conference meeting that they were starting with another package, instead of tax reform, that was my indication that they are very aware of how slim the margins are.WOLF: The recent history is that presidents get two years of unified government, and as a result, get one big, signature piece of legislation. Barack Obama got Obamacare; Trump got tax cuts in his first term. Joe Biden got the big-spending Inflation Reduction Act. What will the one big thing be for Trump 2.0?FOX: If they stick with the current order that they’re talking about – which is by the way, not a sure thing – but let’s say that they try to tackle immigration first, the budget process in the Senate that allows you to pass a bill with 51 votes, known as reconciliation, has a lot of limited parameters around what you can actually do.So Republicans can’t do wide, sweeping immigration policy changes through that first bill.But what they could do is invest a lot of money in border security. They could basically plus up how much they’re spending on those priorities, and they could move some money around. That could still be really significant for the Trump administration, because Trump talked about the border so much and because Republicans campaigned on that issue.I could very well see that being a major signature piece of legislation for Trump that would fit with his brand.On the other hand, you have a series of tax breaks that are going to expire at the end of the year in 2025, and I do think Republicans are cognizant of that and don’t want a situation where Americans blame them for taxes going up or businesses blame them for taxes going up.So I think it’s possible that they could do both, but I do think that if immigration comes first, that’s probably the more likely victory.WOLF: Trump made a lot of promises about tax cuts during the campaign – ending taxes on tips, ending taxes on Social Security benefits and more. There was talk by the incoming vice president, JD Vance, of expanding the child tax credit. Is there any indication that any of that will actually happen in such a closely divided Congress, when Democrats are probably going to oppose some of it? Maybe not the child tax credit, but some of that other stuff?FOX: I don’t think Republicans are counting on Democrats for their tax bill. Even if there are provisions that Democrats might agree with, it’s going to be a big lift for them to get any Democratic votes, which is why they’re going to do this through reconciliation.Republican lawmakers are entertaining some of the ideas that Trump suggested on the campaign trail. There’s a reality, though, which is that some of those ideas cost a lot of money. Not taxing Social Security benefits – that costs a lot of money.And these things are going to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, and Republicans are going to have to publicly defend why they’re adding to the deficit at a time when they’re saying the government waste, fraud and abuse needs to end.There are Republicans in both the House and the Senate, on the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, who have been working for a year now trying to brainstorm ideas of what they might want to include in another tax bill. And part of that has been getting a sense of how much some of these provisions cost.It’s really sort of a game of trying to match what you want to do with how much you want to spend. And that’s the really complicated part of this process.WOLF: The last couple of years, Johnson has had to get help from Democrats in order to pass spending bills. Is that likely to continue after Trump becomes president? In other words, will there be hard-line Republicans that oppose spending bills just because they oppose spending, or will it just be a party-line situation on these things?FOX: It’s going to have to be bipartisan in both the House and the Senate. And the reason is you cannot pass spending bills through reconciliation, which means you need 60 votes in the Senate.So my guess is, if you get Democrats in the Senate, you’re going to lose Republicans in the House and need Democrats in the House. So I think that that’s a trend that we’re just going to see continue.WOLF: Will that set up a dynamic that is a repeat of the first Trump administration, when Trump caused a government shutdown even though Republicans controlled the House and the Senate? Do you think that they will be shyer about shutdown threats in this term, or is that a tool Trump will go back to?FOX: It’s hard to predict the dynamics that could cause a shutdown. For example, if we’re talking about March, which is potentially when we would have the next spending deadline, do you really want to have a shutdown in your first 100 days? I think that that’s the kind of political calculation you have to make, and so it’s hard to know, right?I would be very surprised if Republicans want to go down that road in Trump’s first 100 days. Does that dynamic change in September? Does that dynamic change at another point? It’s possible.It also is possible that Democrats dig in a little more, because they know that it would be cataclysmic to have a shutdown in Republicans’ first 100 days of trying to legislate.WOLF: We’re all focusing on Republicans because Democrats won’t control anything starting in January. How are they going to stay relevant? How are they going to stay visible?FOX: A couple of ways. Democrats are still going to be needed to do the basic functions of governing.When we are talking about the debt ceiling, when we’re talking about spending, it’s more likely than not that you are going to see Democrats helping. Because more likely than not, you’re going to see the middle – more swing-district Democrats, swing-district Republicans – working together to pass those bills.The other place that you’re going to see Democrats a lot is in these confirmation hearings. They may not be using the same sort of hard-charging tactics we saw in the first Trump administration, when they would deny Republicans quorums for votes in committee or those kinds of things, but what we will see is they’re going to ask hard questions and make made-for-TV moments.The sense I’ve gotten, and I’ve reported on this pretty extensively, is that Democrats are really trying to figure out what happened in November, and they are being cautious about when they decide to dig in against Trump and when maybe that wouldn’t be beneficial.As Democrats have said to me, if you say everything’s a five-alarm fire, then nothing’s a five-alarm fire, right? They’re going to be cautious about where they pick their moments.

And his apparent near-mirroring of the 2016 map would indicate that he paid no political price for his lies about fraud in that election, his efforts to overturn it, or the criminal charges he has faced since then.He is now poised to return to office with a Republican Senate majority, easing his path to confirming his choices for key government posts. It’s not yet clear which party will control the House.Democrats, meanwhile, will be forced to confront difficult questions about the direction of the party — on the issues, and on its appeal to critical segments of the electorate, particularly the Latinos whose realignment could reshape American politics.Here are eight takeaways from the 2024 election:Though several states are still tallying their results, Trump’s road to victory in 2024 appears to have been nearly identical to his 2016 win.Both campaigns had long been focused on seven swing states: the “blue wall” of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.There were no surprises — no states that unexpectedly slipped into Trump’s column, despite his musings about winning blue states like New Mexico and Virginia.However, Trump has already claimed Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and he leads in all seven battlegrounds. In 2020, Joe Biden had won six of those seven — losing only North Carolina to Trump.The final count could take weeks, but Trump also holds the popular vote lead. If that edge holds, he’d be the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to win the popular vote.Harris’ loss will once again leave disappointed the millions of women who hoped to see the history-making moment when what Hillary Clinton famously called the “glass ceiling” was shattered.There was a significant gender split, with the majority of women backing Harris, but men supporting Trump, CNN’s exit polls showed.The only segment of the electorate with which Harris made notable gains over Biden’s 2020 performance was with college-educated women — the voters who had propelled the party’s strong suburban performance in the 2022 midterms.Abortion rights, the issue that fueled Democratic wins in 2022, on ballot initiatives and in special elections, proved less potent this year.Harris performed much worse than Biden among voters who said they thought abortion should be legal in most cases — even though the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in between the two elections.Four years ago, 26% of the electorate held that opinion, and Biden won them by 38 points. This year, 33% held that opinion, and Harris won them by just 3 points.It’s a result that suggests the issue wasn’t the deciding factor for many of those voters — even though Democrats had succeeded in the 2022 midterms, special elections and more by highlighting the GOP’s role in ending Roe v. Wade’s national abortion rights protections.Republicans won back the Senate majority that they held during Trump’s first term but lost when he was defeated in 2020.The GOP win would have significant ramifications for a new president —easing Trump’s path to having nominees for the Cabinet and other key posts confirmed.Democrats entered the 2024 election cycle with only one or two seats to spare (depending on which party was in the White House, and therefore held the vice president’s tie-breaking vote) — and an all-but-impossible map to defend, with three seats in deep-red states on the ballot.Republicans won all three of those races. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s retirement effectively guaranteed Republican Jim Justice’s win there. Montana Sen. Jon Tester lost to 38-year-old former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown fell short against businessman Bernie Moreno.Democrats hoped a long shot would materialize — crossing their fingers that Rep. Colin Allred could oust Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or that former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell could buck Florida’s rightward trend and beat Sen. Rick Scott. Neither came close.Three Senate races in the Great Lakes battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were also neck-and-neck. Their outcome will determine the size of the GOP majority.Republicans now face a battle to replace Mitch McConnell as the party’s leader in the chamber, after the Kentucky senator said in February he would step down from his leadership post. Texas Sen. John Cornyn and South Dakota Sen. John Thune are the two top candidates.Democrats didn’t want to discuss it before the election, but they’re talking about it now.With Harris’ loss of the presidency and with the Senate coming under GOP control, the House could become the party’s last line of defense in Washington.With so many votes still to be counted and races to be called, it’s hard to say whether House Democrats are on a path to victory or are headed for another close defeat. Democrats have had some good news out of New York and California, which could on their own kick out enough GOP incumbents to make Hakeem Jeffries the next House speaker.What that would mean is, simply, that Trump would be unable to pass much, if any, legislation and perhaps more importantly would find himself hamstrung as he tries to wind back Biden’s policies.RELATED ARTICLE
Trump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years agoThe CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law investing in memory chip manufacturing, would be on the chopping block if Republicans keep their majority, but absent that, most would assume it’s off the table. Same goes for any move to uproot the public investments doled out by the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction acts, which appear safe for the time being.Obamacare, too, would almost surely be in the clear. (Republicans couldn’t repeal it with a governing trifecta in 2017, so talk of repeal might be over anyway.) Though all of these laws – the signature achievements of the last two Democratic administrations – seem safe if Democrats get their majority, there will still be tough fights at the administration and agency levels about how they’re managed.But on an otherwise bleak night for Democrats, a fighting chance is the best the party can ask for.If Trump does return to the White House, he will have rural counties across the battleground states to thank.There will be a lot of back-and-forth over why Harris underperformed Biden in big cities and their suburbs, but the fact remains she won in those places mostly by significant margins.RELATED ARTICLE
Here’s what Trump is proposing for the economyStill, Trump’s margins in rural America appear to have been simply too large to overtake. It turns out that there were, in fact, more votes for the former president to mine in counties like central Pennsylvania’s Huntingdon, a short drive from the campus of Penn State University, where he’s on pace to outperform both his vote total and margin from four years ago.Harris’s performance in corresponding strongholds was pretty much the inverse.In Montgomery County, home to a big chunk of the Philadelphia suburbs, Harris is on pace to win about 60% of the vote. The problem for the vice president – and it’ll be something Democrats spend a lot of time chewing on – is Biden fared about 2.5 points better than that.There was a similar dynamic on display in Michigan’s Oakland County, too, where Trump again turned out his base and, in some places, added to it, while Harris appears unlikely to match Biden’s 14-point advantage.Small numbers in the grander scheme of an election so big, expensive and plainly complicated could seem negligible – but they add up. And on Tuesday, the math appeared to be on Trump’s side.Well before the outcome of the presidential election came into view, one thing was crystal clear for Democrats as Tuesday night rolled on: There would be lots of finger-pointing around the party. The results were not just a disappointment at the presidential level. In parts of the country where Democrats won and expected to win, the margin was far from comfortable.RELATED ARTICLE
Where Harris’ campaign went wrongEven in a scenario where Trump would be able to turn out his base, Democrats thought a surge of support among women voters thanks to an emphasis on abortion rights in races across the country would keep the presidential race close.“As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race,” wrote Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon in an email at one point in the night.But as the night dragged on, it was not nearly as narrow as Democratic polling and public polling had projected. It became clear to Democrats that they were no longer the party with an ongoing advantage among minority voters and labor unions. And they will have to think about how to win over those constituencies and where they went wrong in messaging and ground game.“There’ll be plenty of critiques and so on,” Democratic strategist David Axelrod said on CNN – before going on to praise Harris as a candidate despite the results.Trump’s campaign pushed hard to court men, and particularly men of color. CNN’s exit polls showed it paid off.Chief among Trump’s gains compared with his performance against Biden in 2020: Latino men. Trump won that cohort by 8 points, four years after losing them by 23 points. It’s a result that showed his campaign’s efforts to court those voters paid off — and that the late focus on a comedian mocking Puerto Rico at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally didn’t cause the damage Harris’ campaign hoped it would. The gains were concentrated most heavily among Latinos under age 65.Trump also made gains in key places among Black men, more than doubling his 2020 performance in North Carolina.Overall, the exit polls painted a picture of an electorate displeased with the state of the nation and its leadership.Nearly three-fourths of voters said they were dissatisfied or angry with the way things are going in the United States, CNN’s exit polls found. Trump won about three-fifths of those voters. Biden was deeply underwater, with 58% of voters saying they disapprove of his performance as president. Four in five of those voters backed Trump.Harris slipped compared with Biden’s performance four years ago among young voters, independents, moderates and union households.Voters who said democracy was the most important issue overwhelmingly backed Harris, but Trump won those who identified the economy as most important by nearly the same margin.Florida’s decades-long status as a presidential swing state is over.Two years after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis romped to a 19-percentage-point reelection victory, Trump backed it up with another double-digit GOP win.In heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade County — traditionally a huge source of Democratic votes — the massive swing was on full display. What had been a 29-point Hillary Clinton win in 2016 was an 11-point Trump victory this year.Florida even bucked the national trend of states of all political stripes backing abortion rights ballot measures in the two and a half years since Roe v. Wade’s reversal.A majority of Florida voters there backed a ballot measure to legalize abortion, but it fell short of the state’s 60% threshold to win passage — meaning the state’s six-week ban remains in place.There are deeper reasons for Democrats to despair. The party’s historic voter registration edge has all but evaporated by 2020, and now Republicans — fueled by migration to the state since the coronavirus pandemic — have the lead. The GOP has won every governor’s race since 1994, and gerrymandered districts have locked in its supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature.As it sheds its swing-state status, Florida could be on track to become the next Texas — poised for a generation of Republican dominance built on a coalition of older, non-college-educated voters, younger Hispanic voters, conservatives migrating from other states and more.Ohio, another traditional presidential battleground, is also now solidly in the red column. Trump was cruising to a double-digit victory there.This story has been updated with additional developments.

CONTENT: FEC filings offer only a glimpse of the money tech is pouring into Washington as it seeks to influence governmentSilicon Valley poured more than $394.1m into the US presidential election this year, according to a Guardian analysis, the bulk of it coming from an enormous donation of about $243m Elon Musk made to Donald Trump’s campaign.The analysis of new election data from the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) shows the increasingly heavy influence of the tech industry in US elections. Advocates of cryptocurrency were particularly active in this election as they fought to stave off regulation, pumping money into the presidential campaigns and key congressional races.The donors came from tech’s biggest companies: Google, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Netflix. Others were powerful venture capitalists who had made billions from investing in tech.Trump overall received $273.2m in donations from some of tech’s biggest names, including:$242.6m from Elon Musk, owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter) who has an estimated net worth of $350bn.$5.5m from Marc Andreessen, the billionaire founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z. Andreessen’s co-founder, Ben Horowitz, initially supported Trump but flipped to Harris.$5.1m from Jan Koum, the founder of WhatsApp who made the bulk of his fortune when Facebook acquired the messaging app in 2014 for $19bn.Kamala Harris received a total of $120.9m, including:$51.1m from the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who left the social media company in 2008 to start the workflow software company Asana.$17m from Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn.$11.7m from Chris Larsen, the billionaire chair of Ripple, a cryptocurrency company.The FEC filings offer only a glimpse of the millions tech is pouring into Washington as it seeks to influence government and regulators. The accounting of US political giving is complicated and opaque and donors can find ways to give money without it being publicly reported.There are a few ways a person can donate to a political campaign in the United States. The first is a direct contribution to a campaign, which is capped at $3,300 per candidate. The second is donating to a political action committee (Pac) that contributes directly to a political campaign, helping to pay for staffing, outreach, events and advertising.The 2010 landmark supreme court case Citizens United v FEC made it much easier for industries and wealthy individuals to contribute to a political campaign, often in ways that are hard to track but that are entirely legal.The court’s decision gave way to a third, more opaque way of donating: Super Pacs. Corporations and wealthy individuals can give an unlimited amount of cash to a Super Pac. The only caveat is that Super Pacs can’t contribute to a campaign directly – but they can spend all they want to on political advertising for their preferred candidate.Individual and corporate spending on campaigns are thus virtually limitless. It’s how Elon Musk donated his $242.6m to Trump’s campaign, and how many others were able to spend millions supporting their candidate of choice.For many of Trump’s wealthiest supporters, Trump’s rhetoric was overshadowed by his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. The cuts significantly decreased taxes for the wealthy and for corporations.Trump has also blessed his closest supporters with unfettered access to the White House since his win in November. For Musk, $242.6m was probably a small price to pay for the direct line he now has to the president-elect: Trump appointed Musk to co-head the new “Department of Government Efficiency”, or Doge, an advisory commission to evaluate government spending, with fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.It’s an about-face from just two years ago when Musk said that Trump should “hang up his hat and sail into the sunset”. For his part, Trump had bashed Tesla and SpaceX and said he could make Musk “drop to his knees and beg”.But Musk isn’t the only billionaire who endorsed Trump after publicly criticizing him for years. Andreessen was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a critic of Trump’s anti-immigration stances. The Sequoia venture capitalist Doug Leone called the January 6 insurrection “horrific” and held Trump responsible for the attack in the aftermath, but ultimately went on to donate $3.5m to his campaign this year.The tide of reversals is indicative of an ideological shift happening in Silicon Valley. Big tech long eschewed Washington but has become increasingly involved in politics as it has coalesced around crypto and AI, two relatively new technologies that have yet to see much government scrutiny or regulation.Friendliness toward Trump has shown to be fruitful for industries looking to stave off regulation. Oil and gas executives donated millions of dollars to Trump’s campaign, with the former president promising to “drill, baby, drill”.Crypto’s donations, and Trump’s changing views, have also arguably already borne fruit. On Wednesday, Trump nominated Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners, to be head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US’s top financial watchdog. Atkins is seen as crypto-friendly and would replace Gary Gensler, whose efforts to clamp down on the $3.5tn crypto market have set him at loggerheads with the digital currency community.Though companies in the fossil fuel industry are typically the top corporate spenders in elections, the cryptocurrency lobby is quickly becoming the biggest spender in US elections. According to a report from the progressive thinktank Public Citizen, the crypto industry was the top corporate contributor in the 2024 election.Much of crypto’s impact was seen in congressional elections – the crypto lobby spent $40m tanking the campaign of the incumbent Democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown – but crypto had its hands in the presidential races, too.Though Trump was once a critic of crypto, calling it a “scam”, he has since embraced the industry as its advocates have entered his circle. Trump himself has launched a cryptocurrency.In May, Trump became the first presidential candidate to accept donations in bitcoin. Shortly after, the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire founders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, donated a combined $2.5m, much of it in actual bitcoin, to Trump’s campaign. Tyler Winklevoss has called Gensler “evil” and both twins have lobbied hard for light-touch regulation of the industry.The twins had some of their bitcoin refunded by Trump’s campaign committee after they exceeded the maximum cap for donating.Over the summer, Trump praised the Winklevosses as “male models with a big, beautiful brain”.Harris too indicated that she would be more supportive of the industry than her counterpart in the White House. It seemed to pay off: Chris Larsen, chair of Ripple, a cryptocurrency company that manages its own digital token, gave at least $11.7m to Harris’s campaign.“She knows people who have grown up in the innovation economy,” Larsen said in October, of Harris. “I think she gets it at a fundamental level, in a way that I think the Biden folks were just not paying attention to.”Crypto advocates were “willing to hedge their bets and play both sides”, said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen. “In any individual race where they thought one candidate was the crypto candidate, they weighed in heavily and often got real results.”But dark money is not just a thing of the conservative right. The Guardian’s analysis omitted a key donation from Bill Gates, the second-wealthiest person in the world, who reportedly donated $50m to Harris’s campaign. That’s because his donation does not appear in FEC data, since he donated the money through a non-profit, which doesn’t have to disclose donors.“There are many avenues of giving. A big one of them is non-profits, that are secret and the limits are almost nonexistent,” Gilbert said. The US “has a complex system, and it exacerbates our problem of too much money in politics, by making huge swaths of it secret”.

CONTENT: Donald Trump’s decisive election victory was about many things: a global rejection of incumbents, a rise in the Republican electorate and a battle for the future of America’s democracy. But voters consistently and repeatedly said issue No. 1 this election was the economy.That explains a lot about why Trump was reelected.By several major metrics, the US economy is on fire, the envy of the rest of the world. But Americans still viewed it unfavorably, and a significant number of voters blame President Joe Biden and Trump’s opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, for failing to make enough improvements to Americans’ financial situations over the past four years. Poll after poll suggested that Americans hold largely negative views about the US economy.That’s because economic sentiment doesn’t always match up nicely with data that shows the economy is adding jobs, consumer spending is growing and gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the economy — continues to boom. When you pay through the nose for a cup of coffee or when you can’t afford to buy a home, those data are meaningless: You feel shut out of the American Dream.Housing: America’s home prices have reached new record highs for 15 straight months. That’s great news if you own a home — and not so great if you don’t, especially with mortgage rates remaining stubbornly high, just below 7%. That’s why a record low 2.5% of homes switched owners this year, the lowest in 30 years, according to Redfin.Rent isn’t offering much relief: About half of American renters shelled out more than 30% of their income on rent in 2023. Households that spend more than 30% of their income on rent, mortgage payments or other housing costs are considered “cost-burdened” by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.The housing affordability crisis has helped exacerbate America’s wealth gap, leaving people who are forced to move or don’t own a home in a financial bind. But many people who are hardly poor are also struggling to get by, largely because of how much it costs to live in a home: A fifth of US households that earn more than $150,000 a year are living paycheck to paycheck, according to a Bank of America survey.Prices: Inflation is back to normal. But that doesn’t mean prices are falling — they’re just not rising at the alarming level they were a couple of years ago.Prices are roughly 20% higher now than they were when Biden took office, leaving Americans with a daily reminder of how much inflation stinks every time they go to the store. Gas prices have fallen dramatically over the past couple of years, sinking from a record average high of above $5 in 2022 to below $3 a gallon in many states now. That has helped, but not solved, the inflation problems many Americans continue to face on a daily basis.Politics: A lot of how you feel about the economy depends on your politics. And the number of registered Republicans in America is growing.A recent study from the Brookings Institution, released last week, found a correlation between economic sentiment and political affiliation with the party in control of the White House. When Trump took office, Republican economic sentiment surged, while Democratic sentiment cratered. The opposite happened when Biden took office.But Republicans are three times more likely to think the economy is good when a Republican is in office than Democrats when a Democrat holds the White House — and the reverse is true, too.Still, Trump will be inheriting a strong economy — on paper, anyway.Jobs: The biggest indicator of economic security is whether or not you have a job, and a historically high percentage of people do. Even though the unemployment rate has been ticking higher over the past year, at 4.1%, it remains at a very healthy level, rising incrementally from the lowest unemployment rate since the first moon landing.The US economy’s job-creation machine has slowed this year — particularly in recent months. Last month, the economy added just 12,000 jobs. Still, the economy is continuing to add a monthly average of 170,000 jobs this year, which is almost exactly the number the economy added during the first three years of the Trump administration, before Covid hit (175,000 jobs per month).Companies are still clamoring so much for workers that the number of job listings is greater than the number of American job seekers, according the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.GDP: The broadest measure of the US economy is booming. Gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 2.8% last quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Wednesday. That’s a healthy pace by any measure, and it’s on par with the economic expansion during the Trump administration, when people were feeling much better about the state of the economy.It has also made America’s economy the envy of the world: Projected US economic growth for this year remains the strongest of any of the G7 economies, according to the International Monetary Fund.Paychecks: Workers’ paychecks aren’t booming like they were a couple years ago when inflation was truly off the rails. But they’re still growing at a 3.9% adjusted rate, according to the Depart﻿ment of Labor. That’s still a faster clip than inflation, which means the amount of money Americans have to spend is growing.Inflation-adjusted disposable income per capita rose for the 27th straight month, according to the BEA, the longest streak on record.Consumerism: Despite polls to the contrary, consumers are acting like the economy is great. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of America’s economy, is surging, rising 3.7% last quarter, the highest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2023, according to the BEA.And consumer confidence is on the rise, too — it surged in October by the largest amount in any survey since March 2021. Still, it remains well below where it was before the pandemic, during Trump’s first term.

CONTENT: A “series of inadvertent and unforeseen events” resulted in Colorado voting system passwords being posted on the Secretary of State’s website, an outside investigator said.A Denver attorney did not find any intentional wrongdoing by Secretary of State Jena Griswold or staff in her office, but said two policies were violated. Attorney Beth Doherty Quinn suggested in her report, dated Sunday, that the agency require a more thorough review of documents before they are posted on the secretary’s website and better protection of passwords.The passwords — “only some of which were still active,” Doherty Quinn said — were on hidden tabs in a spreadsheet containing information about county voting systems that was posted on the secretary’s website on June 21. The information had previously been posted as a PDF that could not be manipulated, but an employee suggested posting the information in a spreadsheet software in the interest of transparency. The hidden sheets were discovered on Oct. 24.The passwords were one of two needed to access components of the Colorado voting system, Griswold’s spokesperson Jack Todd has said. Griswold said it was not a security threat.The tabs that included the passwords had been hidden in a file kept by a former employee. None of the employees involved in posting the document online knew that hiding tabs was a feature of the software, the investigation found.The “substantial weight of the evidence” shows the hidden tabs with the passwords were posted “mistakenly, unknowingly and unintentionally,” because the employees involved were unaware the hidden worksheets existed, Doherty Quinn wrote in her report.Doherty Quinn recommended the office require all passwords to be stored using software called a “password safe,” and to create a checklist of things that need to be reviewed before something is posted on the website, including seeing if there are hidden tabs and removing any metadata.
